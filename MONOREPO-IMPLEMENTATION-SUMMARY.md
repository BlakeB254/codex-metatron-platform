## 📋 Migration Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create individual repositories on GitHub
- [ ] Run preparation script to backup current state
- [ ] Document environment variables and dependencies
- [ ] Set up CI/CD templates for each service

### Phase 2: Service Extraction (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Run extraction script to create service repositories
- [ ] Migrate each service with full Git history
- [ ] Set up independent CI/CD for each service
- [ ] Test extracted services independently

### Phase 3: Submodule Integration (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Remove original directories from main repo
- [ ] Add services back as Git submodules
- [ ] Update build system and package.json
- [ ] Test monorepo functionality

### Phase 4: Stabilization (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Fix any integration issues
- [ ] Optimize development workflow
- [ ] Train team on new processes
- [ ] Complete documentation

## 🔧 Management Commands

### Basic Operations
```bash
# Initialize everything
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh init

# Update all submodules
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh update

# Check status
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh status

# Install dependencies everywhere
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh install
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch in all repos
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh branch feature/new-feature

# Run command in all submodules
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh foreach "npm install"

# Update and push all changes
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh pull
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh push
```

./scripts/submodule-manager.sh add https://github.com/org/new-service.git services/new-service

# Remove service
./scripts/submodule-manager.sh remove services/old-service
```

## 🚨 Important Considerations

### Before Migration
1. **Team Training** - Ensure team understands Git submodules
2. **Backup Strategy** - Multiple backups of current state
3. **Rollback Plan** - Clear procedure to revert if needed
4. **CI/CD Dependencies** - Update all deployment pipelines

### During Migration
1. **Staged Approach** - Migrate one service at a time
2. **Testing** - Thorough testing at each phase
3. **Communication** - Keep team informed of progress
4. **Documentation** - Update docs as you go

### After Migration
1. **Monitoring** - Watch for performance issues
2. **Team Support** - Help team adapt to new workflow
3. **Optimization** - Continuous improvement of processes
4. **Documentation** - Keep docs updated

## 🔄 Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Nx Integrated Monorepo
- **Pros**: Excellent build caching, great developer experience
- **Cons**: Single repository, complex for large teams
- **Decision**: Not suitable for independent service deployment

### 2. Lerna Package Management
- **Pros**: Good for npm package management
- **Cons**: Still single repository, limited for microservices
- **Decision**: Better for library management than services

### 3. Separate Repositories
- **Pros**: Complete independence
- **Cons**: Difficult shared code management
- **Decision**: Too much overhead for shared resources

### 4. Git Submodules (Chosen)
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds - independence + shared resources
- **Cons**: Learning curve for Git submodules
- **Decision**: Optimal for our use case
